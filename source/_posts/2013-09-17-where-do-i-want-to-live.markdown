**Welcome to my blog.**

This blog is used to document my daily intuitions and inductions, mainly focused in the area of science and life philosophy. As the blog name shows, I want the following documents could be helpful to see the iceberg beneath the sea, step by step.

I like to collect cool projects/tools to improvement visual enjoyment and human-nature interaction. As time goes, I will put the most interesting ones onto this platform. Hopefully you will enjoy it.

The blog is under constructing, welcome to any suggestions.
